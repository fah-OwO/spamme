# spamme
There are 2 versions :

1)spamme.py
normal version with using .txt to edit so
-> it is better to use if you have imoticon( like ðŸ¥º or ðŸŽ¶ ) in sentence

2)spamme_tk.py
use tkinker so
-> it is more easy to use but
-> it will not fully support imoticon and will be harder to edit if there is an emoticon

(how to use on spamme.tk)
open it and you will get some weird .txt file.
just write on it > save > close .
and it will auto paste your sentence line by line on what you choose in lower window.
most line suggestion on youtube:8 line.
you can edit it whatever you want!wwww

(how to use spamme_tk.py)
there will be spamme2.txt file on your desktop
if you open(run) it tkinker will appear so 
 just place sentence on text tab and click "send" button
 if you wanna save your current text to spamme2.txt click "save to txt" button
 if you wanna load text from .txt click "load from txt" button
  add "<wait(second)>" to let this pprogram wait(time.sleep()) eg. <wait3> for wait 3 sec
